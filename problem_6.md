# Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists

union: for the first list all elements are stored into a set , removing duplicated , for the second list is checked if the element is not already on the set, then adding the element on the tail. time complexity O(n) space O(n)

intersection: for the first list all elements are stored into a set, for the second list its checked if the element is on the set , if it is is added to the linked list. time complexity O(n) space O(n)
